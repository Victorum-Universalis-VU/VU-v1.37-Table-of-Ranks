Diamond trade started 1450s, but didn't really flourish until mid 1600s. Briefly after silting of the Zwin in Bruges, Antwerp became the sugar capital of Europe, processing most Spanish & Portuguese sugar, before falling to the Spanish Fury in 1576, and seeing the diamond business begin in earnest in 1580s.
