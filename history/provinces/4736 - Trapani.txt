} # Peace of Caltabellotta ends the War of the Sicilian Vespers (1282-1302), confirming Frederick III of Sicily's de facto status and granting him the title of King of Trinacria (alternate name of Sicily), while giving the peninsula (Naples) to Charles II of Naples. Sicily held as a kingdom under Aragon (calling it a PU for now)
