 # Events:
 ME_Castile_Events.1.t: "Presence in Arguim"
 ME_Castile_Events.1.d: "As it turns out, we finally managed to discover the Island of Arguin. The Island of course, had been already discovered before, and so we need to decide. As we already know, the Portuguese crown lays claim to the island and lands around it, but there haven't been made many attempts on colonization quite yet by our dearest neighbors."
 ME_Castile_Events.1.a: "Honour their rightful claim."
 ME_Castile_Events.1.b: "Claim the province as ours."
 ME_Castile_Events.1.c: "Honour their rightful claim."
 ME_Castile_Events.1.e: "Disregard the claim."
 ME_Castile_Events.1.f: "Claim of our ally means nothing to me."
 ME_Castile_Events.1.g: "Establish a Penal Colony in there!"
 ME_Castile_Events.1.h: "Interesting Discovery."
 ME_Castile_Events.2.t: "Law of the Forest"
 ME_Castile_Events.2.d: "Recently, in one of our Canadian colonies, we were approached by some sparsely-clothed Indians regarding the 'rules' of these newfound lands. Though we could not receive the exact translation, we seem to have the general idea: 'now this is the law of the forest, as old and as true as the sky, and the wolf that shall keep it may prosper, but the wolf that shall break it must die. As the creeper that girdles the tree trunk, the law runneth forward and back; for the strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack.' These wise natives were, rather ironically, found dead three days later from a wolf attack."
 ME.Castile_Events.2.a: "We shall discard this knowledge."
