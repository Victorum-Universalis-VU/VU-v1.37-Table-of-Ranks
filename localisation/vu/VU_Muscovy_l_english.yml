 VU_Muscovy_Events.10.t: "The Subjugation of Novgorod"
 VU_Muscovy_Events.10.d: "After sieging down and occupying the city of Novgorod, many think that the war will be over. We could send a diplomat to their leaders with demands: Be annexed and we will end the violence. The people are begging for peace and dying in the streets. The chances of this offer being accepted is high but some military advisors and nobles expect to be rejected by them. Anyhow, victory is ours!"
 VU_Muscovy_Events.10.a: "Let us see how much they care about their people..."
 VU_Muscovy_Events.10.b: "We shall make our own version of peace!"
 
 VU_Muscovy_Events.11.t: "The Subjugation of Novgorod"
 VU_Muscovy_Events.11.d: "A diplomat has come from the vile Rurikovich hound. He offers to end the violence if we agree to be annexed. While the war has been gruesome and hard for our people, perhaps there is still a chance of victory?"

 VU_Muscovy_Events.11.b: "God shall guide us to revenge!"
 
 VU_Muscovy_Events.12.t: "We got a peace treaty rejection!"

 VU_Muscovy_Events.13.t: "Consolidation of Lands"
 VU_Muscovy_Events.13.d: "Now that we control vast lands north of Moscow, we need to decide how to manage these lands. Many nobles are eager to take control of the various castles and villages but that would allow them to increase their influence. Perhaps the Crown should seize the lands and control it directly? Doing this would infuriate the nobles though..."
 VU_Muscovy_Events.13.a: "Castles for the Nobles!"
 VU_Muscovy_Events.13.b: "The Crown shall rule these lands."
 VU_Muscovy_Events.13.tta: "Gain §R2.00§! unrest in §YEvery Owned Province§! without core of §Y[From.GetName]§!.\n"

 VU_Muscovy_Events.14.t: "The Governing of Novgorod"
 VU_Muscovy_Events.14.d: "Some Nobles from the former republic have come to us with a plea. They ask to reconsider our decision about the former Republican lands. They say that the citizens are treated poorly and unequally. They suggest that we give some concessions to improve the situation. While this would be beneficial some of our advisors say that cracking down on such traitorous talk should be our priority."
 VU_Muscovy_Events.14.a: "Crack down on the separatists."
 VU_Muscovy_Events.14.b: "Grant some concessions."
 VU_Muscovy_Events.14.c: "The situation works for now."

 VU_Muscovy_Events.20.t: "The writing of the Sudebnik"
 VU_Muscovy_Events.20.d: "While we grow as a nation, so does our administration grow. We have gotten many petitions from the peasantry and nobility with, of course, different interests. Many see that it is time to combine all our laws and change some of them in this new age of our nation. The only problem is that it will be hard to not favor a certain group. One thing is certain: This could become a double-edged blade."
 VU_Muscovy_Events.20.a: "Nothing to lose, but our chains."

 VU_Muscovy_Events.30.d: "A woman, claiming to be a close relative of last Basileus, has come to our capital. She asks us for protection from the vile Turks and residence in Moskva. An opportunity showed itself though, we could decide to marry this woman. Doing this could result in increasing our prestige and religious importance and in the future make us have certain claims."
 VU_Muscovy_Events.30.a: "Rome lives on."
 VU_Muscovy_Events.30.b: "We shall not walk in the shadows of others."
 
 VU_Muscovy_Events.40.t: "An Emissary from Beyond the Caucasus"
 VU_Muscovy_Events.40.d: "We have discovered that we are not the only ones who despise the Turks. Far in the north is a heathen kingdom who is quite powerful. We could perhaps ally this nation and target our rival. This way we would have a chance of defeating them once and for all. Some of our mystics protest however claiming that Allah will give us victory instead of a heathen nation."

 VU_Muscovy_Events.41.t: "A Message from the Rus"
 VU_Muscovy_Events.41.d: "A strange man has come from a far away land called Persia. He says that he is a diplomat with an offer from the local ruler. The offer would contain an alliance aimed at taking out the Turks. It is known that we would benefit from their demise but is it worth a heathen ally?"
 VU_Muscovy_Events.41.a: "We gladly accept!"
 VU_Muscovy_Events.41.b: "We shall do it ourselves!"

 VU_Muscovy_Events.60.t: "Opening of the Moscow Cannon Yard"

 VU_Muscovy_Events.60.a: "No walls will hold us back!"
