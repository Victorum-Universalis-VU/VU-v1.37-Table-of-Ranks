Your boyars have failed you, so now you turn to God and Voievode! And yet you do not plead? You do not kneel to dust your heads with ash? Instead you wail, 'Why has God forsaken us?' We must look into the trials we failed long ago! In a time past, after the death of Mircea the Great we have allowed unholy forces to slip into our domains. The offspring of our inaction was the rise of the Ottomans and Islam... Yet we did not banish it, instead studying their vile language and religion for our own power and wealth! And the monsters at our door... the unholy infidels who abduct our young for their jannisary corps ? Did we raise our swords against them? Or did we lay our burden on others? The so-called Hajduks...

Sent to fight the heathens or our bretheren for whomever pays better... they could not distinguish good from evil. Yes, their numbers have dwindled throughout the years. But still few roam our lands, offering their bloody work for coin. To this day they shame us with their very existence! Wallachia bleeds, flogged by war! The battles are Gods' whip, chastisement for our sins! And let us not forget the terrors, the scourges from beyond our world! The Strigoi rule the skies with every full moon! The dark raiders abduct our children into lands unknown! Some say they herald the Apocalipse! Can we chart a course back into the light? Will we find the strength to banish heathens from our kingdom?

The battle started after Mehmed, who already had tense relations with Vlad, discovered his alliance with Hungary's king Matthias Corvinus and ordered his forces to ambush him. Vlad foiled the attack and invaded Bulgaria. In response, Mehmed raised a great army with the objective to conquer Wallachia and annex it to his empire. The two leaders fought a series of skirmishes, the most notable one being the conflict where Vlad attacked the Turkish camp in the night in an attempt to kill Mehmed. The assassination attempt failed and Mehmed marched to the Wallachian capital of Targoviste, where he found a few men with cannons. After leaving the capital, Mehmed discovered 23,844 impaled Turks whom Vlad had killed during his invasion of Bulgaria. The number is mentioned by Vlad himself in a letter to Matthias Corvinus. The sultan and his troops then sailed to Braila and burned it to the ground before retreating to Adrianople.

We've been struggling for domination for centuries now. It is high time to crush this nation in order to truly claim the ownership of all Rus.

Seeing that our control over Wild Fields is rather weak and Zaporozhia can't quickly defend for themselves, he now demands that all of his rightful cores are returned to Crimean Khanate. This means, Cossacks will be pushed out of East bank of Dnieper and will likely see this action as betrayal."

Opposing armies of Muscovy and Great Horde has faced each other on the Ugra River. Great Khan judged the position unfavorable and retreated. This humilating defeat not only shows the strength of Muscovite army but weakness of the Horde, thus formally ending the Tatar Yoke over Rus."

It reached its peak prosperity around 13th century, after which it began slowly declining due to many reasons such as climate changes, depletion of resources, declining help from Iceland, lowered trade relations from black death and declining importance of Icelanding fish exports. After many harsh years, last remaining settlements there gave up of further continuing this agony.

From now on, Aspand ruled this land semi-independendly posing major problem to Qara Qoyunlu. Despite many pitty conflicts and battles, the rebelion is sill going on and old Aspand still controlls the majority of southern territories. Aspand does not have an heir and he's getting old, so his uprising may end very soon, but we cannnot expect the best outcome and do nothing."

Beginning in 1436, ibn Falah spread his messianic beliefs amongst the less powerful Arab tribes along the area of the Khuzestan and Basra, gaining converts in an attempt to forge a strong tribal alliance. In 1441, they succeeded in capturing the city of Hoveyzeh in Khuzestan, and during the following ten years the Musha'sha'iyyah increased their strength and consolidated their power in the area around the city and the Tigris. \n \nNow that Qara Qoyunlu is ridden by civil war and internal conflicts, a perfect opportunity appears to spread the power and influence of Mushasha. We can use their instability to demand land in Lower Mesopotamia that is populated by our shiite brothers. We must continue our early military ambitions that fueled by Muhammad ibn Falah's zealous millenarian theology, which significantly influences our military tactics."

Byzantine emperor demands large recompensation for the paid tribute, threatening to wage open rebellion if we don't comply. \n\nCrushing the Byzantines once and for good has been our goal for years and now this seems like perfect opportunity to strike the City of World's Desire.

 VULegacyIberianFlavour.EVTDESC1: "The Kingdom of Sicily had after the defeat of René of Anjou in 1443 been unified into a single entity under the Crown of Aragon. However, Alfonso V of Aragon had fathered an illegitimate son, and so during his reign decided to once again split up the Two Sicilies into two constituent kingdoms: One controlling the islands of Sicily & Malta, while the other controlled the parts on the Italian Peninsula. Upon his death, the rule of Naples was ceded to this illegitimate son, Ferdinand, while his brother John II of Aragon incorporated Sicily into the Crown of Aragon. This sparked a series of events such as Pope Calixtus III laying claims over all of Naples as a papal fief (Though he died before he could push these claims), as well as causing great unrest among the Neapolitan nobility. Eventually, when the Italian Wars erupted some decades down the line, the French kings claimed rightful succession to Naples itself and attempted its conquest. This ultimately failed, and Naples reunited under the Crown of Aragon 10 years later. And so, the Two Sicilies would remain ruled by Aragonese, and later Spanish, kings for centuries."

 PriceChanges_VictorumUniversalis.EVTNAME5: "The Birds and the Bees"
 PriceChanges_VictorumUniversalis.EVTDESC5: "As the Enlightenment spread across Europe, several important advancements in science were made by natural philosophers. One of these advancements concerned the complex science of bees and their biology, a topic that had not previously been researched. Some notable pioneers were Jan Swammerdam & René Ferchault de Réamur, who used microscopes to dissect bees to understand internal bee biology. They observed queens laying eggs in open cells, but it was not until François Huber had his advisor conduct careful experiments that they understood the mating process of bees. They found that queens were inseminated through a number of successive matings with male drones, which occurred high in the air, distant from their hive. They were also the first to describe bees' reproductive organs. Huber is today regarded as the father of modern bee-science for his discoveries and research while simultaneously breaking new ground in the formative years of modern biology."

 #
 PriceChanges_VictorumUniversalis.EVTNAME6: "Buzzkill Bee-Gone"
 PriceChanges_VictorumUniversalis.EVTDESC6: "Beekeeping in Medieval and Renaissance Europe was a complex science that no regular peasant really understood. Beekeeping was therefore mostly left to the monks in abbeys, where the precious honey and beeswax was produced. This was not the only reason for its generally limited production, but in order to obtain said produce, beehives had to be destroyed, thus ruining any potential reuse of the bee colony. It also disallowed any potential selective breeding. This gradually changed during the 18th and 19th centuries, where successive inventions revolutionized beekeeping. Among these were Thomas Wildman's adjustments to beehive assembly. He fixed parallel arrays of wooden bars across the top of a straw hive. The bees would fix their combs onto these, which allowed for easy removal of beecombs without destroying the hive itself. These movable comb hives were later perfected by Lorenzo Lorraine Langstroth, who made use of the fact that there was a specific clearance between the wax combs which bees left unblocked by wax, something Huber had previously discovered. Langstroth carefully designed a series of woooden frames in a rectangular hive box which were easily removed by beekeepers for emptying or inspection. Langstroth's invention ultimately lead to the commercial mass production of honey in the western world."

However, the Golden Inlet, the primary route to the North Sea from Brugge and also the reason for its immense wealth, began to fill with silt around the year 1500, leading to a progressive and sudden reduction of Brugge's importance as a centre of trade in the Low Countries as more and more trade moved to Antwerp."

The abject failure of the Reformation to take hold in Gaelic Ireland is attributed to a variety of factors, foremost amongst which may have been the fact that, contrary to most other Reformist and Protestant movement in Europe, the Church of Ireland refused to make use of the local language, instead disseminating materials in English. Combined with Ireland's disillusionment with England's foreign policy this created the perception that the Reformation was yet another attempt to conquer Ireland and break Gaelic influence.

All Dearbhfhine, the male decendants of previous kings up to four generations back, are to vote in the selection of a new Tanist so that in the event of the King's death the Tanist will immediately accend to the position, securing the succession and maintaining the uninterrupted leadership of the Kingdom."         #Was going for a historical basis, but it seems to history-book-ish, so rewriting it, but leaving the old one here   -   Tanistry is the traditional inheritance law of Ireland and most of Britain. Under this system, a Tanist is elected by popular vote of the Dearbhfhine, or the decendants of a previous king up to four generations back, from the available Righdamhna, or kingly material, who are Dearbhfhine of the age of majority and without any physical or mental deformity. Unlike most primogeniture succession laws on the continent, it is common for a brother, uncle, or nephew to be first in line to inheirit, and also unlike most elective monarchy laws on the continent, only the direct descendants of previously ruling kings were eligible. This system is highly stable and typically ensures a compentent king is chosen, but it also occasionally causes civil wars between distant cousins.

 VictorumUniversalisCelticFlavour.EVTNAME3: "A... Female Heir?"
 VictorumUniversalisCelticFlavour.EVTDESC3: "A new heir is now is line to the throne of [Root.GetName], but to the consternation of all, this heir is a young woman! The role of the king is to act as steward to the kingdom and, as part of the inauguration, ritually marries the female personification of the kingdom, imbuing her and by extension the land with his fertility. As a woman cannot fulfill this role, women are traditionally not eligible to ascend to the throne. The prospect of a female ruler is thus enveloping the entire kingdom in a dread panic that upon the ascension of [Root.Heir.GetName], the kingdom will begin to wither and die. Doomsayers proclaim that first the crops, then the livestock, and finally the people will shrivel up and die as the land becomes barren and empty. The royal advisors suggest that a small sum be set aside for the girl's inheritance and that she be disinherited from royal succession."
 VictorumUniversalisCelticFlavour.EVTOPTA3: "[Root.Heir.GetName] will make an excellent ruler, there is nothing to fear."

At long last having a capable, adult Tanist will reassure the people and resolve the unrest bred from the fear of lacking leadership in a crucial time."
 VictorumUniversalisCelticFlavour.EVTOPTA4: "This should finally appease the naysayers."

 VictorumUniversalisCelticFlavour.EVTNAME5: "A Strong Woman Candidate"
 VictorumUniversalisCelticFlavour.EVTDESC5: "In a most unusual and unexpected turn of events, a headstrong and capable young woman has garnered support from some of the Dearbhfhine, and is being considered by many as Righdamhna, and thus eligible for the throne, despite the fact that typically her anatomy would preclude her consideration. Her opponents warn against a woman in the position, as the king is ritually married to the kingdom and his fertility is meant to ensure the success of harvests and livestocks. Her supporters, however, dismiss this as superstition and cite ancient sources and laws asserting a woman's right of inheritance. Shall we encourage the girl's ambitions, or instead select a less controversial candidate?"
 VictorumUniversalisCelticFlavour.EVTOPTA5: "One of the king's male cousins will make a fine choice."
 VictorumUniversalisCelticFlavour.EVTOPTB5: "To even be considered, this young woman must be worthy!"

 VictorumUniversalisCelticFlavour.EVTDESC6: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] became High Queen of [Root.GetName] today in a grand coronation ceremony, recalling all the pride of the ancient traditions. Despite outward appearances, however, many in the kingdom are fearful for the future, and doubtful of our continued prosperity. The royal court is simply waiting for the young queen to make a mistake, and word has reached us that small riots are appearing in all reaches of the kingdom as the superstitious fear that their beloved kingdom will become as barren without a symbolic husband. If the High Queen is to prove these doubters wrong, she will have to endure much in the years to come."
 VictorumUniversalisCelticFlavour.EVTOPTA6: "She will have to prove herself..."

 VictorumUniversalisCelticFlavour.EVTNAME7: "The High Queen Has Proven Herself"
 VictorumUniversalisCelticFlavour.EVTDESC7: "After 20 years on the throne, the kingdom under the High Queen has not shriveled up and died. Calves continue to be born, harvests continue to ripen, and the people have not succumbed to some miasma of hopelessness and despair. Even the staunchest traditionalist is forced to admit that [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s reign has erased any doubt that a woman may rule in [Root.GetName]. In the future, female Tanists will likely face less resistance."
 VictorumUniversalisCelticFlavour.EVTOPTA7: "She has indeed proven herself!"

 VictorumUniversalisCelticFlavour.EVTDESC8: "Following the tragic death of our former Tanist, we are facing pressure to appoint a replacement so that our kingdom may never be without a strong leader in the event of the unexpected death of the king. The Dearbhfhine has met and the Righdamhna have presented themselves, all that remains is to vote in the new Tanist, who will immediately assume control of the kingdom in the event of the king's death."

 VULegacyUpperNileEvents.EVTDESC1: "Historically our home has been the northern part of the Sudd, a sprawling and near-untraversable swampland located along the upper reaches of the White Nile. Recently, however, our southerly neighbours, the Shilluk, are encroaching more and more upon our territory. Faced with the prospect of a war we may not win, many nobles are suggesting we flee to the north, leaving the Sudd to the Shilluk and claiming for ourselves the drier area around the confluence of the White and Blue Niles, which in recent years has been under the control of the waning Alodia."

One such man, named Abdallah, has amassed quite a fortune from the Red Sea trade and has used this newfound affluence to gather a considerable army near our eastern border, now even threatening our sovereignty! Using his wealth and influence he has managed to obtain considerable popular support and stands ready to sack our ancient capital of Soba, should we resist. Alternatively, we could spare the nation a bloody war and abdicate the throne to this Muslim."

Unlike many other cultures in North America the Beothuk largely avoided the Europeans and retreated inland as more and more foreigners showed up on their shores.

Serfs and in particular Indentured Servants were also given their own accomodation outside their master's estates and an education, but this depended on the benevolence of their masters and employers. Overtime. Serfs and Indentured Servants could gain their freedoms in-exchange for their obedience, service, loyalty, and in most circumstances they would offer payment to their masters or employers for their release. With the proper application of time, money and education most Serfs would venture forth and set sail for the colonies of their homelands, whilst some would remain and go onto acquiring their own serfs through using money they had gained through enterprise."

They were however, not allowed to live outside the estates of their masters and very few 'if any' were given the chance to educated themselves.

The Swedish nobility in particular did not like the king, as evidenced by them nicknaming him the \"Bark King\". \n\nIn 1448, Christopher suddenly died at the age of 32, leaving a power vaccuum that resulted in the Lord High Constable of Sweden, Riksmarsk Karl Knutsson Bonde, being elected king in Sweden, and Christian of Oldenburg being elected King in Denmark, thus sparking a power struggle in the Kalmar Union that would last until 1457, when Christian of Oldenburg would finally be elected the King of Sweden."

 VULegacyScandinavianFlavour.2.d: "The Swedish nobility and the privy council upon electing Karl Knutsson Bonde as King of Sweden sought to unify the Kalmar Union under a Swedish king instead of the Danes. As Christopher yet had little support in Norway, attempts were made at convincing the Norwegian nobles, their Council of the realm, to elect Karl Knutsson of Sweden as their new ruler. Their attempts would succeed at this, eventually crowning Karl Knutsson in the Nidaros Cathedral as king of Norway in November 1449. However, the Swedish aristocracy, mainly the Swedish Church and the noble families of Oxenstierna and Vasa, were very reluctant in backing a Swedish war attempt against Denmark, and so, barely a year later, Karl Knutsson stepped down from the Norwegian throne in favour of Christian von Oldenburg. Later, the Archbishop Jöns Bengtsson Oxenstierna and the nobleman Erik Axelsson Tott rebelled againt Karl Knutsson, exiling him to Danzig and elected Christian as the King of Sweden."

As Danish generals gave the order, soldiers entered the Hanseatic Kontor, grabbed their treasury and slaughtered the burghers within. They entered the Rathaus, and as the local noblemen plead for mercy, few were spared. The city was thoroughly looted and the population was almost cut in half. With all the atrocities committed, there is no doubt that the city will take decades, perhaps even centuries, to recover. That is, if it ever will. One thing is for certain however: Once the other Hanseatic cities will hear of this onslaught, they'll harbor great hatred, but also fear, of us and our military."

 #PriceChanges_VictorumUniversalis.EVTNAME1: "The Reinheitsgebot"
 #PriceChanges_VictorumUniversalis.EVTDESC1: "In the duchy of Bavaria-Munich in 1487, Duke Albert IV decreed with the subordinates of the realm the Reinheitsgebot - Purity Law - of Bavarian beer. The law stated that beer produced in Bavaria may only ever contain water, barley and hops. Any diversion from this recipe would invalidate its claim to the name and would lead to its confiscation. The law also standardized the price of beer with a maximum price of a Mass, the Bavarian Liter, at one Pfennig in the winter and two Pfennig in the summer. Innkeepers were however allowed to add an additional half Pfennig per Mass to the sell price, but only if they bought a sufficient amount of 120 Mass from the producer. This law was later then expanded by William IV to include all of Bavaria upon its reunification in 1516. While the law was not the first among beer laws, it was the most famous and would be upheld throughout the history of the Duchy, up until the German Unification in 1871, upon which its application to all of Germany was one of the conditions of said treaty."

 PriceChanges_VictorumUniversalis.EVTNAME2: "Top or Bottom Brewing"
 PriceChanges_VictorumUniversalis.EVTDESC2: "Normally, most beers produced before the 19th century would be produced and brewed at room temperature, as possibilities of refrigeration were limited. If the temperature was too high such as in the summer, the beer would spoil. Bavarians would then attempt to use the colder caves around the Alps to brew the ale. At some point in the 15th-16th centuries when Bavarians stored beer in these caverns during the winter, they accidentally discovered that the brew tasted differently - instead the flavour was more mellow and smooth. This developed into a new brewing process, during which they also discovered that the wort of the beer behaved differently, sinking to the bottom instead of rising to the top, thus coining the terms top-and-bottom fermentation. As this process took weeks instead of days and thus required a prolonged storage period, the beer was nicknamed \"lager\"."

Its composition remained unknown until the 1750s when a French chemist managed to decompose the dye into an iron salt and a new acid, isolated and termed 30 years later by Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele as \"Blue acid\". Prussian Blue became very important in Europe as it obsoleted the very expensive lapis lazuli previously used for blue coloring, as well as becoming the main color used in Prussian army uniforms and continued to be used for ceremonial purposes up into the 20th century."

 VULegacyItalyHRE.EVTNAME1: "Cession of the Kingdom of Italy"
 VULegacyItalyHRE.EVTDESC1: "Italy, long claimed by the emperor to be part of the Holy Roman Empire, has gradually slipped more and more from the Empire's control. Though occasionally emperors have been able to exercise some influence over the succession and laws in Northern Italy and there are many circles which pledge loyalty to the Empire, this politicking has become, more than anything else, a way to avoid the temporal power of the Pope, and a long string of coalitions and alliances designed to resist imperial influence have arisen, starting with the Lombard League in 1167.  Though the Empire's de-facto control over Italy was tenuous at points, it wasn't until the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 that imperial power was formally broken and all claims over Italy retracted by the emperor as a concession of the treaty to end the Thirty Years' War."
 VULegacyItalyHRE.EVTOPTA1: "Finally an end to the meddlesome emperor's control!"
 VULegacyItalyHRE.EVTOPTB1: "Let us lobby the emperor to remain within the Empire!"
 VULegacyItalyHRE.EVTNAME2: "Italian Loyalists"
 VULegacyItalyHRE.EVTDESC2: "Through the Peace of Westphalia, the Holy Roman Empire was force to release all claims over Italy, but it would appear that several imperial holdings on the peninsula don't wish to leave! We have received delagates from several Italian cities requesting our support to remain within the Empire and retain the full advantages that being a member of our noble Empire provides. We could easily accept these pledges of loyalty, but it might be seen as a violation of the treaty."

 VULegacyItalyHRE.EVTNAME3: "Imperial Loyalists"

Ghibellines are rejoicing in the streets!"   #Note to people poking around & translators - I welcome better ideas, and if you want to rewrite when translating, that is fine!
 VULegacyItalyHRE.EVTOPTA3: "For the emperor!"
 VULegacyItalyHRE.EVTNAME4: "Removed from the Empire"
 VULegacyItalyHRE.EVTDESC4: "The emperor is either unwilling or unable to accept our pledge of loyalty, and has turned our delagates away. Italy is henceforth no longer an imperial holding and our nation losses all rights as an imperial fief, effective immediately."

 VULegacyItalyHRE.EVTNAME5: "The Kingdom of Italy and the Peace of Westphalia"

No English governor wants to be remembered as the one to surrender Calais and in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] prominent nobles are claiming that Calais is English and should remain so. However, French forces have began to amass in great numbers and their emissaries have repeatedly been reminding us now on a daily basis that should we not acquesc to the demands of their sovereign [FRA.Monarch.GetName] and \nUnless we surrender Calais to them immediately that France will officially declare a state of war on our nation."

In one last attempt to force the question [Root.Monarch.GetName] has approached Calais himself and demanded the governor to surrender the city as all formerly held English forts surrounding it have been destroyed.\nThe governor, however, shows no signs of intending to surrender the city, despite not having a force strong enough to withstand the impending attack from French forces that surround the city."
