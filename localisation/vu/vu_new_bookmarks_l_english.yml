 MAGNA_CARTA: "Magna Carta - §REXPERIMENTAL§!" #1215
 MAGNA_CARTA_DESC: "The Magna Carta commonly known as the 'Great Charter of Freedoms' is signed as a royal charter with prior rights agreed to by King John of England at Runnymede, near Windsor, on 15 June 1215 at the behest of 25 noble barons. First drafted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Cardinal Stephen Langton, to make peace between the unpopular king and a group of rebel barons, it promised the protection of church rights, protection for the barons from illegal imprisonment, access to swift justice and limitations on feudal payments to the Crown, to be implemented through a council of 25 barons. Unfortunately, neither side stood behind their commitments leading to the charter being anulled by Pope Innocent III and thus subsequently resulting in the 'First Barons' War' between 1215-1217."
