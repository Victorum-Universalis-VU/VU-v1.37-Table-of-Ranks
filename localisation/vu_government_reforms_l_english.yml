Contrary to places and areas in Indonesia and Malaya, Filipino polities are a very advanced indigenous governmental system, with soldiers and armies adorning Chinese influenced weaponry and armor. It is said that Ferdinand Magellan and his Spanish comrades were in shock when they first encountered Datu Humabon's forces and later that of Lapu Lapu as he lay bleeding on the beaches of Mactan island from an arrow (possibly of Chinese design) that had pierced him directly in the eye. Rulers of this system also grew rich from both domestic and international commerce with tea, porcelain, weapons, cloth and ivory being imported from China, Japan, Arabia and East Africa, in exchange for spices, gems, gold and diamonds. It is even said that trade extended all the way from Manila to India as far west as the East Coast of Africa. Indeed, African fragments have been found in urban areas throughout the Archipelagos that were once considered major centres of trade and Filipinos are still considered to this day as very amiable and skilled mariners, making up a significant workforce of today's modern merchant marines."
