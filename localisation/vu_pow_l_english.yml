 #Attitudes
 vu_pow_neutral_attitude: "Surrender Allowed"
 desc_vu_pow_neutral_attitude: "We allow enemy combatants to yield, surendering themselves to us. By using their captured equipment we gain the replenish our armies at a hastened rate after a battle due to you getting the §YReplenishment boost§!, capturing the soldiers also gives a §YReplenishment Penalty§! to the enemy nation.\n"
 vu_pow_friendly_attitude: "Ecourage Surrender"
 desc_vu_pow_friendly_attitude: "By encouraging enemy combatants to surrender instead of figting until the bitter end, we can capture a larger volume of enemy soldiers. We can use this to our advantage, allowing soldiers wishing to continue their craft to fight on our side, replenishing our manpower reserves, we also gain the §YStrong Replenishment Boost§!. \nThough this strategy is good at replenishing your own army, your enemy suffers no penalties due to your friendly attitude.\n"
 vu_pow_hostile_attitude: "Spare no Quarter"
 desc_vu_pow_hostile_attitude: "While executing enemy combatants may be a warcrime, the Geneva convention doesn't exist yet and it's the medieval world, so yea, this was a common practice back then. \nRegardless, by taking no prisoners you do inflict extra morale damage, and though you do not gain anything yourself, the enemy will feel the §YHarsh Replenishment Penalty§!.\n"
 vu_pow_slavery_attitude: "Prisoner-Slaves"
 desc_vu_pow_slavery_attitude: "All captured combatants are forced into slavery. After a battle you gain a §YReplenishment boost§!, and the enemy suffers a §YHarsh Replenishment Penalty§!.\n"
 vu_pow_sacrificial_attitude: "Prisoner-Sacrifices"
 desc_vu_pow_sacrificial_attitude: "Captured combatants are held for future sacrifices for the gods. After a battle you gain a §YReplenishment boost§!, and the enemy suffers a §YHarsh Replenishment Penalty§!.\n"
 vu_pow_noble_ransom_attitude: "Nobility for Ransom"
 desc_vu_pow_noble_ransom_attitude: "We only capture enemy Nobles, which we can later ransom for a pretty penny. After a battle you gain a §YReplenishment boost§!, and the enemy suffers a §YReplenishment Penalty§!.\n"
 vu_pow_cannibalism_attitude: "Cannibalise the prisoners"
 desc_vu_pow_cannibalism_attitude: "Looks like meat's back on the menu boys! \nNow on a more serious note, by consuming enemy combatants you obviously inflict massive amounts of mental trauma, meaning that the enemy recieves the §YHarsh Replenishment Penalty§!, and you, since you got your fill, you still gain the §YReplenishment Boost§!!\n"
 vu_pow_community_service_attitude: "Community Service"
 desc_vu_pow_community_service_attitude: "Captured combatants are forced to help rebild the nation they once swore to destroy, after their sentence has been served they're released from captivity. Due to the relatively humane treatment of prisoners, you gain the §YStrong Replenishment Boost§!, the enemy though is still penalised with the §YReplenishment Penalty§!.\n"
 vu_pow_gladiatorial_attitude: "Prisoner-Gladiators"
 desc_vu_pow_gladiatorial_attitude: "Though not as favoured in present times as it was in antiquity, forcing captured combatants into blood sports was a relatively commonplace thing in less civilised areas of the world. After capturing enough prisoners, you may start an arena fight. \nDue to the difficulties involving capturing enemy soldiers for use in arenas, you gain no §YReplenishment Boost§!, but the enemy still recieves a §YReplenishment Penalty§!\n"
 vu_pow_resettlement_attitude: "Resettlement of Prisoners"
 desc_vu_pow_resettlement_attitude: "By taking captured combatants and sending them to our colonies, we can boost our colonial growth. Unfortunately sending prisoners to penal colonies doesn't help us to reinforce our armies, fortunately the defeated enemy still recieves the §YReplenishment Penalty§!.\n"
 vu_pow_internment_camps_attitude: "Internment Camps"
 desc_vu_pow_internment_camps_attitude: "Despite it sounding very closely to the even worse Concentration Camps, Internment Camps were a relatively common practice during the late 19th to early 20th century. Unlike their remarkably worse counterparts, these camps had only a singular purpuse, to pacify the populace and disarm them in a case of a rebelion, terrorism, betrayal or just to prevent a guerrilla war. \nOne of their last uses was during the Second Boer war in south Africa, but due to their brutality the practice was abandoned shortly afterwards by the British, the practice continued onwards until the end of the Second World war, where the United States of America incarcerated Japaneese nationals en-masse, into Internment Camps. \nMeanwhile in the Nazi Germany, the regime created an even worse version of these; Concentration Camps, with the express purpuse of exterminating people and help with their genocide of the Jews, Slavs, and other people's they saw as 'lesser'. \nThis has been added for the express purpuse of education, we condem all such acts, but just like no quarter orders, they were a part of our history, so not representing them would be denying their existance.\n\nWith that history lesson over, mechanically, Internment Camps allow for easier pacification of areas, reducing the risks of a rebelion. Captured combatants are incarcerated into them, meaning that every once in a while you need to build one such camp to contain your prisoners. Neither you, nor the enemy gain any §YReplenishment Buffs§! or §TPenalties§!\n\n§YAgain please NOTE that the inclusion of this into the mod is for purely educational and or historical purposes so as not to omit historical and or oratory facts from the game that had occured and continue to occur in real life§!."
